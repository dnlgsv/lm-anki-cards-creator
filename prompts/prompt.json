Your task is to analyze it and produce a comprehensive JSON object containing the following information:\n\npart_of_speech: The primary grammatical category of the word (e.g., \"noun\", \"verb\", \"adjective\").\ndefinition: A concise, learner-friendly explanation of the word's meaning.\nexamples: A list of 3 diverse example sentences illustrating how the word is used in context.\nsynonyms: Up to 3 synonyms. If fewer are available, return those you can find, otherwise return [].\nantonyms: Up to 3 antonyms. If fewer are available, return those you can find, otherwise return [].\ncollocations: Up to 3 commonly used collocations with the given word (word combinations frequently found together). If none are available or applicable, return an empty list [].\nrussian: Up to 3 frequent Russian translations of the word.\ncefr_level: The estimated CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) level of the word's difficulty (A1: Beginner, A2: Elementary or Pre-intermediate, B1: Intermediate, B2: Upper intermediate, C1: Advanced, C2: Proficient).\ntopics: Topic vocabulary used when discussing specific topics or subjects (such as \"business\", \"technology\", \"health\") or \"general vocabulary\" for a very universal expression.\n\nIf any category's content is not available, follow the specified fallback (e.g., empty list or None).\n\nOutput Format (JSON):\n\n{\n    \"part_of_speech\": \"<part_of_speech>\",\n    \"definition\": \"<definition>\",\n    \"examples\": [\"<example1>\", \"<example2>\", \"<example3>\"],\n    \"synonyms\": [\"<synonym1>\", \"<synonym2>\", \"<synonym3>\"],\n    \"antonyms\": [\"<antonym1>\", \"<antonym2>\", \"<antonym3>\"],\n    \"collocations\": [\"<collocation1>\", \"<collocation2>\", \"<collocation3>\"],\n    \"russian\": [\"<translation1>\", \"<translation2>\", \"<translation3>\"],\n    \"cefr_level\": \"<cefr_level>\",\n    \"topics\": [\"<topic1>\", \"<topic2>\", \"<topic3>\"]\n}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the word/expression given in triple backticks.\n2. Produce a JSON object according to the structure above.\n3. Ensure the data is accurate and helpful for language learners.\n4. If any field cannot be provided (like collocations, synonyms, antonyms, etc.), return the specified fallback (None for single-value fields, [] for lists).\n5. Output only the JSON object, without additional commentary."
